#### :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: Thank you for visiting. I am @Ken Nipper
#### Software Developer for 30 years.
I develop web and mobile apps with C# Blazor, C# WPF using .Net 5.0 and 6.0.
All of my projects are properly pushed to repositories and are updated(pushed) constantly.
Thank you github for such a wonderful service. 

My favorite databases are SQL Server, MySQL Server and SQLite. Most of my apps
use some form of non-volatile data so download, setup, configure, administer are
always part of the process. 

Security features such as Axure vaults to store sensitive data are always useful
and sometimes required for proper security of applications.

Collaberators are welcome to contact me about gaining access to my private repositories.

My Current Project is for an animal reproduction application. It runs on web browser
and Android and Iphone. All versions of the app are connected to a common SQL Database.
Users can choose to use the web app or also use the mobile versions.
