Security features such as Azure vaults to store sensitive data are always useful
and sometimes required for proper security of applications so I use it on mopst projects as well.

Collaberators are welcome to contact me about gaining access to my private repositories.

My Current Project is for an animal reproduction application. It runs on web browser
and Android and Iphone. All versions of the app are connected to a common SQL Database.
Users can choose to use the web app or also use the mobile versions.
Also check out my new Twitter Stream App that is a scalable tool for processing current tweets for subjects matter and hastags popularity.
